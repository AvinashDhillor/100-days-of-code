        int val = 2, range = val;
        for(int i = 2; i<=num; i++) {
            if(i == val)  {sol[i] = 1; continue; }
            sol[i] = sol[val] + sol[i%val];
            range--;
            if(range == 0) val <<= 1, range = val;
        }
        return sol;
    }
};
```

Another problem i solved is DP problem on hackerrank. It was not DP problem at all but have to took some help from editorial because i was gettin WA for my approach. Also i tried to solve another DP problem but will try again tomorrow.

### Day 2: June 13, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Pratices Problem on LeetCode and Started ProjectEular100 Challenge. Found DP tutorials and problems to improve problems solving that need DP technique.

**Thoughts:** Today i Worked on LeetCode `May Challenge` problems.
These problems are `Find All anagram in a string`, it was quiet easy problem that is solved using sliding window(also called rolling hashing). Second problem was `Permutation in String` in which we have to check whether permutation of string `s` is present in `p` string. Again it was easy like previous problem and solved using sliding window method. Next Problem was `Online Stock Span` problem. It took alot of time because i didn't read problem statement carefully that lead to wrong solution but after at video solution i solved it using stack. Another problem i solved was `kth smallest element in BST` this problem i solved in O(N) using DFS on tree but we have to optimize it to O(height of tree) i looked at tutorial, the solution has little tweaks, instead of using recursion stack STL stack is used so we can break it when we find solution. The optimal solution was O(H + k). I faced a DP problem but i could not think of solution yet but i Searched for DP tutorial and problems. I find some resources to improbe DP problem solving method. **Project Euler** :- I started project Euler today and solved first 3 Problems. The first 3 problems was easy because i have already saw such kind of problems before.

### Day 1: June 12, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Solved programming problems.

**Thoughts:** Today i solved Leetcode 30 days challenge problem and also solved previous. Problem was to perform `insert()`, `remove()` and `getRandom()` in `O(1)` time. I implemented it using two set Data structure and an array. Next Problem was `Finding max sum subarray in circular array`, this problem was bit difficult for me so i have to watch youtube video solution. The solution was quiet interesting. Next problem was to `Place even elements behind all the odd elements` by using O(1) space. This problem was easy.

### Day 0: June 12, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Forked 100DaysOfCode repository and and edit Readme templates.

**Thoughts:** This time i planned to build streak of 100 Days and track progress using application called **Loop Habit Tracker**. I am thinking of giving my best to my 3rd round of 100DaysOfCode without breaking streak.
